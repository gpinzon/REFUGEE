REFUGEE 	[ Rotational historiEs oF yoUnG stEllar objEcts ]
Tool for the analysis of global trends of rotation with magnetic fields and disc timelifes.

Input : File "input.dat" containing :

Col[1] Disk timelife in Myr,
Col[2]  End of simulations in Myr,
Col[3] Characteristic timescale for accretion in yr,
Col[4] Magnetic field strenght in G


Output : File "refugee.dat" containing 26 columns describing the rotational track (mass-vsini) over the mass interval 0.1 - 7.0 Mo

For running just type ./refugee.sh
